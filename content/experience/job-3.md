I served as a Senior Systems Administrator and Network Security Administrator. I was responsible for securing and maintaining a high-traffic infrastructure across multiple regions. My role involved leading internal security audits, working closely with white-hat teams for penetration testing, and deploying monitoring tools to ensure real-time visibility and threat detection. I coordinated system patching, managed disaster recovery plans, and maintained reliable backups for operational resilience. Additionally, I resolved complex network issues, deployed antivirus and asset management agents across environments, and ensured all systems met security and compliance standards. My work directly supported the stability and scalability of a distributed infrastructure serving thousands of affiliates worldwide
