As the sole in-house IT administrator at Praedicat, I was fully responsible for managing and maintaining the company's IT infrastructure across multiple locations. My role combined hands-on technical support with long-term infrastructure planning, ensuring system reliability, security, and scalability for a growing organization.

I led the procurement, deployment, and lifecycle management of hardware, including desktops, laptops, servers, and network equipment. I managed inventory, vendor coordination, and internal asset tracking while supporting all staff with technical troubleshooting and end-user support across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.

I maintained the company's internal network, file sharing, backup systems, remote access, and account provisioning, while also documenting system configurations, network topology, and shared resources. This documentation supported business continuity, onboarding, and security audits.

Security and operational efficiency were priorities. I implemented best practices in access control, system patching, endpoint protection, and secure backups. I regularly reviewed systems to identify risks and worked proactively to reduce vulnerabilities. I also used Python scripting to automate tasks, streamline reporting, and eliminate repetitive manual work.

Key contributions:

 Independently managed all IT operations for a cloud-integrated startup environment

 Procured and supported all end-user and infrastructure hardware

 Resolved internal support issues across teams with minimal downtime

 Maintained detailed documentation of IT systems and processes

 Developed automation scripts to increase efficiency and reliability

This role established my expertise in technical operations, infrastructure support, system security, and cross-functional collaboration — all of which I carried into the Moody’s acquisition project.
