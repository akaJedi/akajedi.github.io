T3Leads, the leading provider of online lead generation and affiliate network services, specializes in delivering top-notch payday loan leads to the financial industry. With a thriving network of over 10,000 active affiliates, the company operates globally, serving clients in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.

As a PHP Developer at T3Leads, I was responsible for using a variety of technologies to create websites and web applications, and developing user-friendly front- and back-end interfaces using HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. I was able to work independently with minimal supervision, maintaining a close working relationship with the Executive team.

I demonstrated a high level of technical skill, as well as strong interpersonal abilities, allowing me to effectively manage multiple tasks in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
