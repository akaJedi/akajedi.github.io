title: My Expirience
---

I specialize in DevOps, cloud platforms, and infrastructure automation, with hands-on experience in AWS, Azure, and hybrid on-prem systems. I’ve supported development and production workloads across Windows, macOS, and Linux, focusing on automation, reliability, and cost efficiency. My work includes designing infrastructure for global teams, building CI/CD pipelines, and transforming legacy environments into cloud-native platforms.

A career highlight was leading Praedicat’s infrastructure transition during its acquisition by Moody’s. As the sole technical lead, I planned and executed the data center decommissioning, cloud migration, and platform consolidation — achieving zero downtime, reducing costs, and accelerating adoption of cloud practices.

I build automation with Python, Ansible, and shell scripting to cut manual tasks, strengthen monitoring, and improve response times. Security is central to my approach, from IAM policy design to endpoint hardening and compliance reviews.

Collaboration and clear communication define my style — aligning IT and DevOps practices with business goals. I’m now seeking opportunities to help teams deliver reliable, observable, and secure systems through DevOps-driven modernization.
