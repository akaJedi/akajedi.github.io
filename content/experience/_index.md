title: My Expirience
---

I’ve worked extensively with AWS, Azure, and hybrid on-prem systems, supporting both development and production workloads across Windows, macOS, and Linux. My background includes designing infrastructure for global teams, implementing automation pipelines, and modernizing legacy environments into cloud-native platforms.

A career highlight was leading the infrastructure transition during Praedicat’s acquisition by Moody’s. As the sole technical lead, I planned and executed the data center decommissioning, cloud migration, and platform consolidation, ensuring zero downtime and lowering infrastructure costs while accelerating adoption of cloud practices.

I also develop automation with Python, Ansible, and shell scripting — reducing repetitive tasks, improving visibility, and building proactive monitoring and alerting systems. These efforts have cut manual workload by up to 40% and significantly improved incident response times. My security experience includes IAM policy design, compliance reviews, and hardening infrastructure through least-privilege access, endpoint management, and configuration audits.

Collaboration is core to my work — I’ve partnered with engineering, security, and operations teams worldwide to align IT and DevOps practices with business goals. Known for clear communication and pragmatic problem-solving, I thrive in environments where infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and automation are driving forces for growth and reliability.

I’m now seeking new opportunities where I can contribute my expertise in DevOps, cloud platforms, and infrastructure automation to help teams build reliable, observable, and secure systems.
