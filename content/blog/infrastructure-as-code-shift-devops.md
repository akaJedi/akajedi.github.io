Infrastructure used to be a mess of tickets, console clicks, and “works on my machine.”  
With Infrastructure as Code, that’s over.

Now we describe servers, networks, and cloud resources the same way we write software: in code, versioned in Git. The result?  
- Environments you can spin up and tear down the same way every time.  
- Changes that can be reviewed, audited, and rolled back.  
- Less guesswork, fewer mistakes.  

Terraform makes this shift simple: `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`.  
You focus on **what you want built**, not on the manual steps to get there.  

That’s why IaC isn’t just another tool—it’s the backbone of modern DevOps.
