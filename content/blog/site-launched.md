ðŸš€ After years of hands-on IT experience, managing infrastructure, supporting teams, and diving deep into DevOps â€” I finally took time to build something for myself.

This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), deployed with GitHub Actions, and hosted on GitHub Pages. Itâ€™s fast, fully version-controlled, and reflects my belief in clean, automated, and transparent technology.

Youâ€™ll find:
- âœ… My experience in infrastructure, security, cloud (AWS & Azure), and IT operations
- ðŸ”„ Live documentation of projects Iâ€™ve built or contributed to
- ðŸ›  CI/CD setup that mirrors real-world practices
- ðŸ§© Occasional blog posts on what Iâ€™m learning, breaking, or fixing

This site is just a starting point â€” Iâ€™ll continue refining it, adding useful notes, and documenting my approach to solving real-world tech problems.

Thanks for stopping by.  
Letâ€™s connect â€” Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, ideas, or just a good nerdy conversation.
