Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — just writing this down to keep it fresh.

It’s a way of organizing code around *objects* and *classes*. Helps with keeping code readable, reusable, and more structured. Four core ideas I want to remember:

- **Encapsulation** — hiding what's under the hood, exposing only what needs to be used.
- **Inheritance** — one class can reuse code/behavior from another. Less duplication.
- **Polymorphism** — ability to use different types through the same interface. Cleaner logic.
- **Abstraction** — focus only on the essentials, not all the internal stuff.

When done right, OOP keeps things clean and easier to manage as complexity grows.

Not about writing fancy code — just a way to structure ideas and logic more like real-world things. Works well with languages like Python, Java, C#, etc.

That’s it. Simple note. Move on.
