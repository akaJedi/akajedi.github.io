# Welcome to my blog!

This section comes from the `_index.md` file in the `blog` folder — easy to customize or remove.

Here I’ll be sharing personal updates, project notes, and thoughts on tech and career. All posts live in the same `blog/` folder and are written in Markdown for simplicity and ease of use.

Hugo also supports other content formats and translations, so I may add posts in multiple languages later on.

Stay tuned for more!
