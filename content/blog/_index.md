Here I share practical DevOps insights, project walkthroughs, and career reflections — from cloud infrastructure builds and CI/CD automation tips to lessons learned in real-world system migrations.

Expect a mix of hands-on tutorials, architecture breakdowns, and occasional personal updates from my journey in tech. All posts are written in Markdown for simplicity, and I may publish in multiple languages when the topic calls for it.

If you’re into AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, automation pipelines, and reliability engineering, you’ll feel right at home here.
