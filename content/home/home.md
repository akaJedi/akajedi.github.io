    content="<p>Based in Valencia, California, I help teams ship faster and safer by turning infrastructure into code and delivery into predictable pipelines. With 15+ years across enterprise IT—servers, networks, identity, and security—I focus on DevOps and platform engineering:— building reliable, observable, and cost-aware systems that scale. Core stack: AWS and Azure; Terraform and Ansible for IaC; Docker and Kubernetes for workloads; GitHub Actions and Jenkins for CI/CD; SSO and IAM with least-privilege access; AD and GPO for secure baselines on Windows, macOS, and Linux. I specialize in clean cutovers and steady modernization: codifying platforms, adopting GitOps practices, and adding guardrails such as policy as code, mandatory reviews, and promotion from dev to prod. I harden identity and endpoints, automate onboarding and offboarding, and make costs predictable through rightsizing, scheduled scaling, and budgets with alerts. Observability from day one—logs, metrics, and traces at every stage. My approach is repeatable: map the current state, define the target, codify it with IaC and pipelines, instrument it, document it, and transfer ownership. I favor small, reversible changes, strong version control, and collaboration across development, IT, and security. The result is a platform engineers enjoy using: self-service golden paths, clear docs, and feedback loops that improve deployment speed, reliability, and security while controlling cost. Open to senior DevOps and platform roles as well as select consulting on CI/CD bootstraps, Terraform landing zones, identity hardening, observability rollouts, and cost reviews.</p>"

    intro_title="IT Infrastructure & Cloud Operations Lead | Systems, Security, DevOps"
    intro_description="<p>Over the course of my career, I have built a deep and well-rounded foundation in IT operations, system administration, infrastructure engineering, and cloud integration, combining technical expertise with practical problem-solving. My professional path has taken me through organizations of all sizes — from agile startups and high-growth technology firms to large-scale, globally distributed enterprises — where I have planned, implemented, and maintained mission-critical systems that directly support core business functions.</p> <p>I have successfully led high-impact infrastructure transitions, including cloud migrations, data center consolidations, enterprise network upgrades, and hybrid environment integrations, ensuring minimal downtime and smooth adoption across teams. My work spans Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms, with hands-on experience in AWS, Microsoft Azure, VMware, Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure-as-code solutions such as Terraform and Ansible. I have collaborated closely with development, security, and business stakeholders, bridging the gap between technical requirements and organizational objectives while ensuring compliance with security frameworks and best practices.</p> <p>In every role, I bring a solutions-focused approach centered on reliability, performance optimization, and security hardening. This includes implementing proactive monitoring with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch; refining CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Jenkins; enforcing identity and access controls through SSO, IAM, and Active Directory; and establishing governance policies that support long-term operational efficiency. I have a proven ability to troubleshoot complex technical issues, design resilient architectures, and optimize cloud resources for cost-effectiveness while maintaining a secure, well-maintained environment.</p><p> Beyond day-to-day operations, I actively contribute to modernization efforts — introducing automation to reduce manual workloads, codifying infrastructure for repeatable deployments, and improving disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Whether supporting end users, advising on technical strategy, or leading infrastructure upgrades, my consistent priority is enabling teams to work faster, smarter, and more securely while aligning technology with organizational goals.</p>"
