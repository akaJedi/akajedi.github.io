My role combined hands-on technical support with long-term infrastructure planning, ensuring system reliability, security, and scalability for a growing organization.
I led the procurement, deployment, and lifecycle management of hardware, including desktops, laptops, servers, and network equipment. I managed inventory, vendor coordination, and internal asset tracking while supporting all staff with technical troubleshooting and end-user support across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.
I maintained the company&rsquo;s internal network, file sharing, backup systems, remote access, and account provisioning, while also documenting system configurations, network topology, and shared resources. This documentation supported business continuity, onboarding, and security audits.
Security and operational efficiency were priorities. I implemented best practices in access control, system patching, endpoint protection, and secure backups. I regularly reviewed systems to identify risks and worked proactively to reduce vulnerabilities. I also used Python scripting to automate tasks, streamline reporting, and eliminate repetitive manual work.
Key contributions:
Independently managed all IT operations for a cloud-integrated startup environment
Procured and supported all end-user and infrastructure hardware
Resolved internal support issues across teams with minimal downtime
Maintained detailed documentation of IT systems and processes
Developed automation scripts to increase efficiency and reliability
This role established my expertise in technical operations, infrastructure support, system security, and cross-functional collaboration — all of which I carried into the Moody’s acquisition project.</div></div></a></div><div class=experience><a href=../../experience/job-4/ class=experience__link><div class=experience__header><div class=experience__meta><div class=experience__date>Nov 2018- Oct 2024</div><div class=experience__title>Sr. System Administrator & IT Engineer</div><div class=experience__company>Praedicat, Inc.
