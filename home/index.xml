 &lt;h1>Sr. DevOps / Platform Engineer&lt;/h1>
 &lt;div class="about-me content lead">
 Based in Valencia, California, I help teams ship faster and safer by turning infrastructure into code and delivery into predictable pipelines. With 15+ years across enterprise IT—servers, networks, identity, and security—I focus on DevOps and platform engineering:— building reliable, observable, and cost-aware systems that scale. Core stack: AWS and Azure; Terraform and Ansible for IaC; Docker and Kubernetes for workloads; GitHub Actions and Jenkins for CI/CD; SSO and IAM with least-privilege access; AD and GPO for secure baselines on Windows, macOS, and Linux. I specialize in clean cutovers and steady modernization: codifying platforms, adopting GitOps practices, and adding guardrails such as policy as code, mandatory reviews, and promotion from dev to prod. I harden identity and endpoints, automate onboarding and offboarding, and make costs predictable through rightsizing, scheduled scaling, and budgets with alerts. Observability from day one—logs, metrics, and traces at every stage. My approach is repeatable: map the current state, define the target, codify it with IaC and pipelines, instrument it, document it, and transfer ownership. I favor small, reversible changes, strong version control, and collaboration across development, IT, and security. The result is a platform engineers enjoy using: self-service golden paths, clear docs, and feedback loops that improve deployment speed, reliability, and security while controlling cost. Open to senior DevOps and platform roles as well as select consulting on CI/CD bootstraps, Terraform landing zones, identity hardening, observability rollouts, and cost reviews.

 &lt;h1>Sr. Technical Support Analyst&lt;/h1>
 As the sole in-house IT administrator at Praedicat, I was fully responsible for managing and maintaining the company&amp;rsquo;s IT infrastructure across multiple locations. My role combined hands-on technical support with long-term infrastructure planning, ensuring system reliability, security, and scalability for a growing organization.
I led the procurement, deployment, and lifecycle management of hardware, including desktops, laptops, servers, and network equipment. I managed inventory, vendor coordination, and internal asset tracking while supporting all staff with technical troubleshooting and end-user support across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.
I maintained the company&amp;rsquo;s internal network, file sharing, backup systems, remote access, and account provisioning, while also documenting system configurations, network topology, and shared resources. This documentation supported business continuity, onboarding, and security audits.
Security and operational efficiency were priorities. I implemented best practices in access control, system patching, endpoint protection, and secure backups. I regularly reviewed systems to identify risks and worked proactively to reduce vulnerabilities. I also used Python scripting to automate tasks, streamline reporting, and eliminate repetitive manual work.
Key contributions:
Independently managed all IT operations for a cloud-integrated startup environment
Procured and supported all end-user and infrastructure hardware
Resolved internal support issues across teams with minimal downtime
Maintained detailed documentation of IT systems and processes
Developed automation scripts to increase efficiency and reliability
This role established my expertise in technical operations, infrastructure support, system security, and cross-functional collaboration — all of which I carried into the Moody’s acquisition project.
