<span class=experience__location>Culver City, California</span></div></div><div class="experience__description d-none d-print-block"><h1>Sr. Technical Support Analyst</h1>As the sole in-house IT administrator at Praedicat, I was fully responsible for managing and maintaining the company&rsquo;s IT infrastructure across multiple locations. My role combined hands-on technical support with long-term infrastructure planning, ensuring system reliability, security, and scalability for a growing organization.
I led the procurement, deployment, and lifecycle management of hardware, including desktops, laptops, servers, and network equipment. I managed inventory, vendor coordination, and internal asset tracking while supporting all staff with technical troubleshooting and end-user support across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.
I maintained the company&rsquo;s internal network, file sharing, backup systems, remote access, and account provisioning, while also documenting system configurations, network topology, and shared resources. This documentation supported business continuity, onboarding, and security audits.
Security and operational efficiency were priorities. I implemented best practices in access control, system patching, endpoint protection, and secure backups. I regularly reviewed systems to identify risks and worked proactively to reduce vulnerabilities. I also used Python scripting to automate tasks, streamline reporting, and eliminate repetitive manual work.
Key contributions:
Independently managed all IT operations for a cloud-integrated startup environment
Procured and supported all end-user and infrastructure hardware
Resolved internal support issues across teams with minimal downtime
Maintained detailed documentation of IT systems and processes
Developed automation scripts to increase efficiency and reliability
This role established my expertise in technical operations, infrastructure support, system security, and cross-functional collaboration — all of which I carried into the Moody’s acquisition project.</div></div></a></div><div class=experience><a href=../experience/job-4/ class=experience__link><div class=experience__header><div class=experience__meta><div class=experience__date>Nov 2018- Oct 2024</div><div class=experience__title>Sr. System Administrator & IT Engineer</div><div class=experience__company>Praedicat, Inc.

I specialize in managing and optimizing technical environments with a strong focus on stability, automation, and security. My background includes hands-on work with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and traditional on-prem systems, supporting both internal development and production environments across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. I&rsquo;ve built and maintained infrastructure for global teams, ensuring operational reliability in hybrid and cross-regional setups.</p><p>One of my most impactful projects was leading the infrastructure transition during the acquisition of Praedicat by Moody’s. I served as the sole technical lead throughout the migration, overseeing data center decommissioning, secure cloud integration, and platform consolidation — all completed without disruption to business operations. This effort not only ensured business continuity but also significantly reduced infrastructure costs and accelerated cloud adoption.</p><p>I also build automation tools using Python scripting to reduce repetitive tasks, improve system visibility, and trigger early alerts for IT health monitoring. These tools have reduced manual workload by up to 40% and improved issue response times across the board. Security remains a core priority in my work, from IAM policy and access reviews to endpoint control and cloud configuration audits — all guided by compliance and best practices.</p><p>In addition to my technical skills, I’m a strong cross-functional collaborator. I’ve worked closely with support, infrastructure, and security teams across different regions to align IT with organizational goals. I’m known for clear communication, fast adaptation, and a practical, results-driven approach to solving complex technical challenges. I’m currently open to new opportunities where I can contribute my experience in infrastructure, IT support, and system security — ideally in a collaborative environment focused on reliability, automation, and growth.</p></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-lg-4"><a href=https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-demo/blob/main/content/experience/_index.md class="btn btn-primary btn-block w-100" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><i class=icon-square-github></i>
