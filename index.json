Helps with keeping code readable, reusable, and more structured. Four core ideas I want to remember:\nEncapsulation — hiding what\u0026rsquo;s under the hood, exposing only what needs to be used. Inheritance — one class can reuse code/behavior from another. Less duplication. Polymorphism — ability to use different types through the same interface. Cleaner logic. Abstraction — focus only on the essentials, not all the internal stuff. When done right, OOP keeps things clean and easier to manage as complexity grows.\nNot about writing fancy code — just a way to structure ideas and logic more like real-world things. Works well with languages like Python, Java, C#, etc.\nThat’s it. Simple note.
