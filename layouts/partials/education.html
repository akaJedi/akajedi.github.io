            <p>
              Alongside my formal studies in programming and law, I invested heavily in modern IT disciplines.  
              I completed an intensive <strong>QA program in Silicon Valley, California</strong>, focused on manual and automation testing with extensive labs, projects, and real-world practice.  
              I also earned certifications in <strong>DevOps Foundations: Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration</strong> (LinkedIn, 2025), and regularly study advanced technical courses on <strong>Pluralsight, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              These experiences extend my education beyond traditional degrees, giving me a solid foundation in <strong>QA engineering, automation, and DevOps practices</strong>.  
              Combined with 15+ years in IT operations, system administration, and cloud infrastructure, this ensures I bring not just theory, but proven, professional-level expertise to every project.
