 &lt;h1>Sr. Technical Support Analyst&lt;/h1>
 As the sole in-house IT administrator at Praedicat, I was fully responsible for managing and maintaining the company&amp;rsquo;s IT infrastructure across multiple locations. My role combined hands-on technical support with long-term infrastructure planning, ensuring system reliability, security, and scalability for a growing organization.
I led the procurement, deployment, and lifecycle management of hardware, including desktops, laptops, servers, and network equipment. I managed inventory, vendor coordination, and internal asset tracking while supporting all staff with technical troubleshooting and end-user support across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems.
I maintained the company&amp;rsquo;s internal network, file sharing, backup systems, remote access, and account provisioning, while also documenting system configurations, network topology, and shared resources. This documentation supported business continuity, onboarding, and security audits.
Security and operational efficiency were priorities. I implemented best practices in access control, system patching, endpoint protection, and secure backups. I regularly reviewed systems to identify risks and worked proactively to reduce vulnerabilities. I also used Python scripting to automate tasks, streamline reporting, and eliminate repetitive manual work.
Key contributions:
Independently managed all IT operations for a cloud-integrated startup environment
Procured and supported all end-user and infrastructure hardware
Resolved internal support issues across teams with minimal downtime
Maintained detailed documentation of IT systems and processes
Developed automation scripts to increase efficiency and reliability
This role established my expertise in technical operations, infrastructure support, system security, and cross-functional collaboration â€” all of which I carried into the Moodyâ€™s acquisition project.

With a thriving network of over 10,000 active affiliates, the company operates globally, serving clients in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.
As a PHP Developer at T3Leads, I was responsible for using a variety of technologies to create websites and web applications, and developing user-friendly front- and back-end interfaces using HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. I was able to work independently with minimal supervision, maintaining a close working relationship with the Executive team.
I demonstrated a high level of technical skill, as well as strong interpersonal abilities, allowing me to effectively manage multiple tasks in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
